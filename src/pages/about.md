# About the Product

    -   The purpose of GetApp is to produce a comprehensive management system of digital assets in a multi-network (Multi Domain) and multi-end device (Cross Device) environment. 
    -   The goal is to produce a system that manages every software element in the network space, as part of the "digital transformation". 
    -   The management is carried out in the "app store" model and takes place in the entire network space (stationary and tactical). 
    -   The system allows control of updating software and content to the end devices - whether by push or pull, allows management of the life of the application, obtaining a snapshot of all versions on the various end devices and taking into account the personalization of the device (location, communication status, partitioning, etc.).

    - The system deals with tactical distribution and was built to deal with multiple edge platforms and multiple tactical networks.
    - Today the system has been deployed in CTS and installations have been carried out in Annon environments (TNG network) as well as in Elbit's tactical radio station.
    - Since the outbreak of the Iron Swords War, the system has been implemented as the agent that distributes the contents of the mapping (in the getmap project) in EVEN.
